# App for second order system analysis

The second order system in control theory is characterised by its Gain, Damping Ratio and Natural Frequency. This project is a simple implementation of an app that allows the user to visualise various responses of a second order system by varying the charateristic variables of the system. This app is created using MATLAB app designer.

## Description

This app was made as an assignment to the Control Systems (ES 245) course offered at IITGN by prof. Nithin V George. Using this app, one can visualise the behaviour of the system as its StepResponse and magnitude and phase of Frequency response (Bode). The app allows one to change the Gain, Natural Frequency and Damping Ratio of a system and then plot its response. There is also a toggle to hold the previously plotted graph so that the change can be easily visualised.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* The app is exported as a standalone .exe app that would require an OS that supports .exe apps.
* To access the MATLAB implementation, MATLAB with the app designer is needed.

### Installing

* For installing the web app you just need to have MATLAB up and running, then open the web app file.
* For the standalone desktop app, follow the procedure as for any other .exe application
